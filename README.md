# Capsule-Networks
Trial scripts for implementing the novel Capsule Network architecture proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf by Hinton, Frosst and Sabour for solving computer vision problems.

In ./mnist experiments:

CapsuleNet: is the implementation of the CapsuleNet architecture derived from Xifeng Guo(https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras) for experimenting with different datasets.

In ./from scratch:

CapsNet MNIST v2.0.x: my attempts to write a capsule network from scratch, in tensorflow 2.x and keras following along Aurelien Geron's script(https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/extra_capsnets.ipynb).
